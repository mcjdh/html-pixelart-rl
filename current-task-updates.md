  - [ ] Implement dirty rectangle tracking for fog updates

- [ ] **Rendering optimization** (`src/renderer.js`)
  - [ ] Implement dirty rectangle tracking for map rendering
  - [ ] Add sprite caching/atlasing system
  - [ ] Optimize viewport rendering to only draw visible tiles

- [ ] **Particle system optimization** (`src/renderer.js`)
  - [ ] Implement object pooling for particles
  - [ ] Limit particle count to CONFIG.RENDERING.PARTICLES.POOL_MAX
  - [ ] Add particle lifecycle management

### Quality of Life Improvements 🔧 (Optional)
- [ ] **Enhanced sprite error handling** (`src/sprites/index.js`)
  - [ ] Add sprite loading validation
  - [ ] Implement fallback sprites for missing assets
  - [ ] Add safe sprite drawing wrapper

- [ ] **Conditional debug logging** (Multiple files)

### Testing & Quality Assurance 🧪 (Recommended for production)
- [ ] **Create unit tests** (New files)
  - [ ] Test core game mechanics (combat, movement, energy)
  - [ ] Test level generation and area progression
  - [ ] Test save/load functionality
  - [ ] Test sprite loading and rendering

- [ ] **Balance testing automation** (Expansion of test-victory.html)

## 🔧 Quick Reference

### Current CONFIG Structure (Simplified)
```javascript
CONFIG = {
    BALANCE: { /* Enemy stats, combat formulas */ },
    UI: { 
        TIMING: { INSTANT, QUICK, NORMAL, SLOW, STORY },
        FONTS: { SMALL, NORMAL, LARGE, URGENT, TITLE }
    },
    DEBUG: { /* 5 essential debug features */ },
    FEATURES: { DIRECTIONAL_COMBAT: true, STATUS_EFFECTS: true }
}
```

### Available Debug Commands 🛠️
Type `debugCommands.help()` in browser console for full list:
- `debugCommands.giveGold(100)` - Add gold
- `debugCommands.teleport(x, y)` - Teleport player
- `debugCommands.godMode()` - Invincibility mode
- `debugCommands.revealMap()` - Show entire map
- `debugCommands.toggleDebugRender()` - Toggle visual overlays

### File Organization Standards ✅
- `src/sprites/enemies/` - All enemy sprites with consistent patterns
- `src/sprites/environment/` - Theme-specific environment sprites
- `src/levels/areas/` - Modular area definitions
