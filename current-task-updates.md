## üîß Quick Reference

### Current CONFIG Structure (Simplified)
```javascript
CONFIG = {
    BALANCE: { /* Enemy stats, combat formulas */ },
    UI: { 
        TIMING: { INSTANT, QUICK, NORMAL, SLOW, STORY },

}
```

### Available Debug Commands üõ†Ô∏è
Type `debugCommands.help()` in browser console for full list:
- `debugCommands.giveGold(100)` - Add gold
- `debugCommands.teleport(x, y)` - Teleport player
- `debugCommands.godMode()` - Invincibility mode
